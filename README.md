My first python project on conditional statement. I created a Bank system to show details of the customer.
I dont want to show my bank name and other details below it so i set up a Password.
But if person enter wrong then it will not show anything like wrong so use else statement also.
I Want to Show only till IFSC Code to my Client and to me Complete Details so Enter 2222 for my Personal and to my Client only 1111 is Required to be Shared and for Unknown Person no Password Need to be Shared.
